# OTLP Log Parser (Go)

## Introduction
This take-home assignment is designed to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and experience in
building a small backend application. We expect you to spend 3-4 hours on this assignment. If you find yourself spending more time
than that, please stop and submit what you have. We are not looking for a complete solution, but rather a demonstration
of your skills and experience.

To submit your solution, please create a public GitHub repository and send us the link. Please include a `README.md` file
with instructions on how to run your application.

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to build a simple backend application that receives [log records](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/)
on a gRPC endpoint and processes them. Based on a **configurable attribute key and duration**, the application has to keep
counts of the number of unique log records per distinct attribute value. And within each window (configurable duration) print /
log these counts to stdout.
Note that the configurable attribute may appear either on Resource, Scope or Log level.

Pseudo example:
- "my log body 1" - {"foo":"bar", "baz":"qux"}
- "my log body 2" - {"foo":"qux", "baz":"qux"}
- "my log body 3" - {"baz":"qux"}
- "my log body 4" - {"foo":"baz"}
- "my log body 5" - {"foo":"baz", "baz":"qux"}

For example for configured attribute key "foo" it should report:
- "bar" - 1
- "qux" - 1
- "baz" - 2
- unknown - 1

Your solution should take into account high throughput, both in number of messages and the number of records per message.

## Technology Constraints
- Your Go program should compile using standard Go SDK, and be compatible with Go 1.23.
- Use any additional libraries you want and need.

## Notes
- As this assignment is for the role of a Senior Product Engineer, we expect you to pay some attention to maintainability and operability of the solution. For example:
  - Consistent terminology usage
  - Validation of the behaviour
  - Include signals / events to help in debugging
- Assume that this application will be deployed to production. Build it accordingly.

## Usage

Build the application:
```shell
go build ./...
```

Run the application:
```shell
go run ./...
```

Run tests
```shell
go test ./...
```
